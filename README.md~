# Machine Learning Investigations
1.  depthMap: learning the motion of spheres from depth maps generated in Unity
2.  depthMapReinforcement: learning the motion of spheres as above but using reinforcement learning (very early stage of development)
3.  dimensionalityReductionVR: using virtual reality (GearVR) to visualize various methods of dimensionality reduction for MNIST
4.  mlProjects.pdf: Ruminations on difficult, speculative but (IMHO) valuable learning projects of special interest to me.
5.  unifiedTreeSearch.pdf:  A short, terse description of an algorithm for statistical analysis for gambling games, unifying exact inference, random sampling, and Bayesian Monte Carlo Tree Search. (DRAFT IN PROGRESS)
