# Machine Learning Investigations
1.  depthMap: learning the motion of spheres from depth maps generated in Unity
2.  depthMapReinforcement: learning the motion of spheres as above but using reinforcement learning
2.  dimensionalityReductionVR: using GearVR to visualize various methods of dimensionality reduction for MNIST
3.  mlProjects.pdf: Ruminations on difficult but (IMHO) valuable learning projects of special interest to me.
4.  bayesianTreeSearch.pdf:  A short description of using Bayesian techniques in Monte Carlo Tree Search for gambling games.
